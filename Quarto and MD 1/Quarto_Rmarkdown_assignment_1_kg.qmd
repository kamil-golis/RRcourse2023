## Ad. 3

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(psych)
library(dplyr)
setwd('C:\\RR_kg\\repositories\\RRcourse2023\\Quarto and MD 1')

data_suits <- read_xlsx('data_suits.xlsx') %>%
  mutate(viewers_millions = as.numeric(viewers_millions))

t(describe(data_suits$viewers_millions))
```



## Ad. 4

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data_suits %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=air_date, y=viewers_millions)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle('Viewership over time (millions) by date')

data_suits %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=no_overall, y=viewers_millions)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle('Viewership over time (millions) by episode number')
```



## Ad. 5

```{r}
data_suits$viewers_delta <- c(0, diff(data_suits$viewers_millions))

data_suits[-1,] %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=no_overall, y=viewers_delta)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle('Viewership delta - episode-to-episode')
```



## Ad. 6

```{r}
delta_s1_s9 <- abs(data_suits$viewers_millions[125] - data_suits$viewers_millions[1])
delta_s3_s5 <- abs(data_suits$viewers_millions[61] - data_suits$viewers_millions[29])
```

The viewership decreased by `r delta_s3_s5` millions between seasons 3 and 9, which seems not that dramatic - yet when we look at the difference between seasons 1 and 9 - it is huge - `r delta_s1_s9`. In general, As the seasons go on, we can observe a negative trend (as presented in plot Ad. 4)
